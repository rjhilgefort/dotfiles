`rjhilgefort` Dotfiles
======================


# TODO

- Figure out how to get the app ids from the app store and put them in `osx-setup` for the commented out apps
- Figure out all the commented out mac settings
- Implement a proper symlink script


# Old Dotfiles

I blew up my previous dotfiles and started from scratch toward the end of 2018. Much cruft was eliminated. Some of the notable differences I decided to change from the last incarnation to now:

- Moved from `Prezto` to `Antigen`
- Abandoned my bespoke `vim` config in favor of community driven projects
- Moved from `Slate` to `Hammerspoon`
